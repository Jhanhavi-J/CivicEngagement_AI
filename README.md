Civic issues, such as infrastructure failures, environmental hazards, and public health concerns, often go unresolved due to inefficient reporting and delayed communication between citizens and authorities. Our Generative AI-powered Civic Engagement & Awareness Platform leverages Azure AI services to catalog, categorize, and summarize civic problems in real-time, enabling faster resolutions.
Civic-EA is a project that provides event management and analytics functionalities. It includes a backend built with Node.js and Express.js, handling event data stored in JSON format.
# Civic Issue Sentiment Analysis - Proof of Concept (POC)

## Project Overview  
This project aims to streamline the process of identifying, categorizing, and summarizing civic issues using **Generative AI** and **Azure Cognitive Services**. By leveraging AI-powered sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction, the platform enables better communication between citizens and authorities for quicker resolutions.  

## Proof of Concept (POC) Objective  
The POC demonstrates how AI can analyze and classify civic issues from various sources (social media, community reports, etc.), providing actionable insights for authorities.  

## Key Features  
- **Real-Time Problem Identification**: Collects civic complaints and categorizes them based on urgency, location, and severity.  
- **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis**: Determines whether an issue is **positive, neutral, or negative** to prioritize critical problems.  
- **Key Phrase Extraction**: Identifies important keywords in reports for better classification.  
- **Community Feedback Integration**: Allows users to provide updates and collaborate on issue resolution.  
- **Automated Reporting for Authorities**: Generates concise reports summarizing active issues and progress.  

## POC Implementation  
1. **Azure Text Analytics API** is used for sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction.  
2. **Postman** is utilized to test API requests and validate responses.  
3. **Flask (Backend) and React (Frontend)** power the web application, providing an intuitive interface for issue submission and analysis.  

## Future Scope  
The POC can be expanded to include **predictive analysis**, **multi-language support**, and **real-time alerts** to further enhance civic engagement and responsiveness.
